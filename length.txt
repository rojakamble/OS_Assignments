The maximum distance between the CPU and Cache memory = Speed/Frequency

Our system can propagate at 85% of the speed of light 

suppose if we want to design a processor that signals in our system is at 4GHz

Given 4GHz = 4,000,000,000 or 4x10^9 cycles/second

Speed of light = 3 x 10^8 meters/second


Therefore the maximum distance between the memory and CPU would be :
= (0.85 x 3 x 10^8) / (4 x 10^9)  
= 0.06375 meters
